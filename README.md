# A Quick Overview:
The Web is a dynamic retrieval setting. An important part of this dynamics is due to the ranking incentives of Web pages’ authors. That is, some are interested in having their pages highly ranked for queries of interest. As a result, they might respond to induced rankings by modifying their documents so as to improve their future ranking — a practice also known as search engine optimization.

The ranking incentives of many authors of Web pages play an important role in the Web dynamics.
Authors who opt to have their pages highly ranked for queries of interest often respond to rankings for these queries by manipulating their pages

The motivation behind this is to better understand and further explore Web dynamics with respect to the inherent competitive retrieval setting which is driven by rank-incentivized authors.

The paper provides a novel dataset for performing Web dynamics analysis by examining temporal changes on documents.
